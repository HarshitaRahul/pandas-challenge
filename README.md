Out of the 780 values given, we got 576 values which we got by dropping duplicate values. Out of them ,84% were male,14% female and remaining others. 

Which inturn shows that the purchase of items is high incase of male than female therefore the total purchase value is  also high when we group by gender/ age.

Similarly, we can find that the age group between 15-19 & 20-24 have purchased more than the age groups which shows that millenials are more keen on purchasing the gaming stuff

Based on the most popular items, we can find that "Final Critic", "OathBreaker","Fiery Glass".... are the most popular items depending on th number of purchase counts. This also show that avg, purchase per person is not going beyond than 4-5$.
